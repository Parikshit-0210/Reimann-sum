# Reimann-sum
This MATLAB project computes and visualizes the Left, Right, and Midpoint Riemann Sums for approximating definite integrals.  The project calculates the sums and generates plots showing the function and corresponding rectangles for each method, providing a clear demonstration of Riemann sum approximations.
